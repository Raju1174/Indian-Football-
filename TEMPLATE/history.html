            The game was introduced to the Calcuttans (then the capital of India) by the British soldiers in the nineteenth century. Very few would know that Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhakari, known as the Father of Indian Football forced his classmates into playing the game in his school compound. Attracted by the enthusiasm of the boys in the school, the European teachers of the school and adjacent colleges encouraged Nagendra Prasad and his companions to promote the game among the students surrounding Calcutta.
